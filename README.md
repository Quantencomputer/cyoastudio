# CYOA Studio

CYOA Studio is a tool for creating simple CYOAs.
A CYOA is a game in which the player chooses a bunch of options from a given list, usually involving a currency system.

CYOA Studio doesn't offer the full possibilities of the image editing programs that are usually used for CYOA creation, but takes a lot of work of the creators hands.

If you just want to use the program, check out the [releases](https://github.com/Quantencomputer/cyoastudio/releases) to download it, or the [website](https://quantencomputer.github.io/cyoastudio/) for more information and documentation.

## Compilation

This project uses Maven. If you'd like to contribute, you either know what to do or your IDE probably supports importing Maven projects.
